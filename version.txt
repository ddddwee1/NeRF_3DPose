07-25:
    - Now kinematics will produce near & far accordingly, instead of using near & far provided in dataset
    - Add visualization codes for rendering
    - Add pose update interval & nerf warm-up iterations

07-26:
    - Add option to use rot6d

07-27:
    - Add cutoff embedder and a learnable scalar for each joint
    - Use entropy loss to sharpen the opacity
    - Idea: Train a vertices transformation network -> adjust shape accordingly

07-30: 
    Plot depth of each pixel (The maximum weight location & softmax weight of each location)

08-01:
    Debug: Reverse the rotation matrix in encoding function
